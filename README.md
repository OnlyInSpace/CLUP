Problem:
The project was inspired to solve extremely inefficient customer lines due to limited customer occupancy of retail businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Description:
The goal of this project is to develop an easy-to-use application that, on the one side, allows store managers to regulate the influx of people within a retail business and, on the other side, saves people from having to line up and stand outside of stores for hours on end.

Features:

    JSON web tokens for authentication
    Role based access control for managers, employees, and customers
    Fully custom appointment scheduler
    Emails sent from Nodemailer for user verification and customer alerts
    Scheduled node-cron job to keep track of late appointments

What I Would Change:
Include form/input validation in the frontend and not only in the backend so that performance is improved. Also apply a useReducer() hook for store business hours since its state management is more complex.
