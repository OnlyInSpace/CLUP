Steps to run the project in VSCode:

IF YOU WANT TO RUN THIS PROJECT, I WILL FIRST NEED YOUR PUBLIC IPv4 ADDRESS. 
This is required so you can access the database!
Go to https://whatismyipaddress.com/  to get your IPv4 and send it to me. 


1.  Install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/ for you system
2.  Install git bash from https://gitforwindows.org/ for your system
3.  Download and unzip the code archive and place the project folder somewhere handy
4.  Open the project folder in VSCode. To do this, you can click on File in the top left corner then select the "Open folder..." option and choose the project
    folder.
5.  Open a new terminal by clicking on "Terminal" in the toolbar and selecting "New Terminal"
6.  In your terminal window, click on the dropdown box and click "Select default shell". This will cause another dropdown in the VSCode editor to appear. Click on     
    "Git bash" which should open a new git bash terminal.
7.  Split the terminal by clicking on the split terminal icon in the top right corner of the terminal window. It's right next to the trash can icon. This should split   
    your terminal window into 2 terminals.
8.  In the first terminal, enter "cd backend" to go to the backend directory.
9.  Then enter the command "npm install" to install package dependencies for the project.
10. Afterward, to start the backend server, enter the command "npm run dev". The backend server will start and the terminal will remain busy/open from now on.
11. While leaving the first terminal open, switch to the second terminal.
12. In the second terminal, enter "cd frontend" to go to the frontend directory.
13. Enter the command "npm install" to install package dependencies for the project.
14. Enter the command "npm run dev" to start the frontend server. If you have a browser open, then the project will automatically open up a new broswer
    window with the application now visible. If the project does not open automatically, then you can simply type localhost:3000/ in your browser's URL to reach
    it.
