Steps to run the project:

1.  Install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/ for you system
2.  Install git bash from https://gitforwindows.org/
3.  Unzip the root of the project into a new folder
4.  Open the newly created folder containing the root of the project in VSCode
5.  Open 2 new git bash terminals
6.  In the first terminal, enter "cd backend" to go to the backend directory
7.  Then enter the command "npm install" to install package dependencies for the project.
8.  Afterward, start the backend server by entering the command "npm run dev". The server will start and the terminal will remain busy/open from now on since
    it's responsible for keeping the backend server running.
9.  Leave this terminal open and switch to the second terminal.
10. In the second terminal, enter "cd frontend" to go to the frontend directory 
11. Enter the command "npm install" to install package dependencies for the project.
12. Enter the command "npm run dev" to start the frontend server. If you have a browser open, then the project will automatically open up a new broswer
    window with our project now visible. If the project does not open automatically, then you can simple type localhost:3000/ in your browser's URL to reach
    it.
