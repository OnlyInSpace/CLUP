Steps to run the project in VSCode:

1.  Install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/ for you system
2.  Install git bash from https://gitforwindows.org/ for your system
3.  Unzip the archive and place the project folder somewhere handy
4.  Open the project folder in VSCode. To do this, you can click on File in the top left corner then select the "Open folder..." option and choose the project
    folder.
5.  Open 2 new git bash terminals by selecting Terminal in the toolbar and choosing the "Split Terminal" option. Make sure the terminal is at the root of the project
    folder.
6.  In the first terminal, enter "cd backend" to go to the backend directory.
7.  Then enter the command "npm install" to install package dependencies for the project.
8.  Afterward, to start the backend server, enter the command "npm run dev". The backend server will start and the terminal will remain busy/open from now on.
9.  While leaving the first terminal open, switch to the second terminal.
10. In the second terminal, enter "cd frontend" to go to the frontend directory.
11. Enter the command "npm install" to install package dependencies for the project.
12. Enter the command "npm run dev" to start the frontend server. If you have a browser open, then the project will automatically open up a new broswer
    window with the application now visible. If the project does not open automatically, then you can simply type localhost:3000/ in your browser's URL to reach
    it.
